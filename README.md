# jasdjames-password-generator-devlop-homework3


## Description 

The intended purpose of this project was to create a password generator. However, after over 30 hours of continual missteps and mistakes. I learned more than in not having the ultimate intended result than I wouldâ€™ve otherwise. With the help of fellow classmate and the instructor leading in the right direction and to the resources ultimately lead me to small successes that I shall celebrate as a victory of will and full attempt. I left my missteps and commented out code as a testament to my many attempts at achieving the desired goal. 

## Installation

## Usage 

The page does not function as it should - I did not have a chance to change the password from its charcode back to a string. It only works when you choose all character types.
